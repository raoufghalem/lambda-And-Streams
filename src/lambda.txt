Some lambda TUTS

for lambda to work ** The variable holding the lambda should be of type INTERFACE and the lambda has 
the same signature as the interface's single method aka. functional interface

Major differences  between Functional programming and OOP:

Functional
	-	write more readable code and maintainable 
	-	bloc of code as values
	
OOP
	-	all code is associated to a class or object
	-	CANNOT assign a method to a variable *not a result* but the code itself
	
	
CLOSURE 
	-	 cannot change the variable once instantiated inside the lambda
